#### If you are already familiar with Docker workflow, you can skip this section.

Pull down a CentOS image from Docker Hub.

```
docker pull centos:7
```

List all docker images available on the host.

```
docker images
```

Execute `cat /etc/hosts` within a container.

```
docker run -it --rm centos:7 cat /etc/hosts
```

Execute `bash` within a container.

```
docker run -it centos:7 bash
```

Run within the container.

```
echo hello > /tmp/testfile
exit
```

See all containers (including stopped).

```
docker ps -a
```

Start the stopped container - the file should still exist!

```
docker start -ai <container-name>
cat /tmp/testfile
exit
```

Install `httpd` inside a new container.

```
docker run -i centos:7 bash -c "yum install -y httpd; yum clean alll"
```

Show all containers.

```
docker ps -a
```

Tag the Centos7 + httpd container.

```
docker commit -m "Centos7 + httpd" <container-name> centos7_httpd
```

Confirm a new image exists.

```
docker images
```

Run a new container that listens on 8080 on the host and forward to 80 in the container.

```
docker run -p 8080:80 -d centos7_httpd /usr/sbin/httpd -DFOREGROUND
```

Confirm httpd is responding.

```
curl http://localhost:8080
```

Tag the container image with a new name.

```
docker tag centos7_httpd quay.io/coreostrainme/centos7_httpd:latest
```

List docker images

```
docker images
```

Push the container to the registry. You will be denied.

```
docker push quay.io/coreostrainme/centos7_httpd:latest
```

Add credentials for a user or account that has access to push to this repo.

```
docker login -u="coreostrainme+f5" -p="SOKP3QB4CA1UW5DFC2DGDGALZ88EWNP5R824PG4AG3IBCTRYASPKJFOLRL3WMG4B" quay.io
```

Attempt to push again.

```
docker push quay.io/coreostrainme/centos7_httpd:latest
```

Output the image locally as a tarball.

```
docker save --output=rhel_httpd-latest.tar centos7_httpd
```
